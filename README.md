# Web Notes

I am a long term user of Apple Notes but truely became of the unreliable web interface they offer to linux users. On many occasion I lots notes while using the Apple Notes app via the browser client. Using the Web makes me feel like a second class citzen when trying to access my own data. 

Enough is enough, I have took it upon myself to make a highly portable, web-based, reliable, and notablily local-first notes app to get rid of my reliance on Apple and their restrictive Notes app.
